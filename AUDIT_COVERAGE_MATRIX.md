# audit coverage matrix

date: 2026-03-11
repository: `neket371/network-stealth-core`
branch: `ubuntu`
baseline snapshot: `ubuntu` working tree after service runtime extraction
total repo-tracked files reviewed: **128**

review depth meanings:
- `manual semantic` — file behavior and contracts were traced manually.
- `contract consistency` — file was reviewed against current runtime/docs/workflow contracts.
- `inventory-only` — file was inventoried and classified, but has no deep runtime semantics.

## current audit-level findings referenced by matrix

- `f-003` — core root entrypoints remain large enough to raise maintainability and refactor risk, though `config.sh`, `service.sh`, and `install.sh` were already reduced by focused module extraction.
