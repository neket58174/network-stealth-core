## [unreleased]

### changed

- interactive `install` now always requires an explicit config count on the normal path; `--num-configs` remains the scripted override
- raised the manual `global-50` config-count ceiling to `15` while keeping non-interactive auto defaults at `5`
- made pinned bootstrap by commit the visually first-class quick-start path for real servers and added stronger wrapper hints for floating mutating bootstrap usage
- decomposed `lib.sh` into focused ui/logging, system-runtime, downloads, and runtime-input modules
- added sanitized `make vm-proof-pack` / `scripts/lab/generate-vm-proof-pack.sh` evidence bundles for vm-lab lifecycle runs
- added public issue templates and a pull request template for cleaner bug/support/feature intake
- refreshed pinned github action revisions to node24-safe upstream shas and taught self-hosted/nightly vm-lab workflows to upload proof-pack artifacts

## [7.1.0] - 2026-03-07

### changed

- made the strongest-direct contract the managed baseline: `vless + reality + xhttp + vless encryption + xtls-rprx-vision`
- introduced `/etc/xray-reality/policy.json` as the managed policy source of truth
- promoted `clients.json` to schema v3 with provider metadata, direct-flow fields, and three variants per config
- added the `emergency` field-only variant (`xhttp stream-up + browser dialer`) while keeping `recommended` and `rescue` as the server-validated direct path
- added `data/domains/catalog.json` and planner/provider-family awareness for more diverse config sets
- expanded `scripts/measure-stealth.sh` into `run`, `compare`, and `summarize` workflows and persisted measurement summaries
- added `export/canary/` for portable field testing and promoted `export/capabilities.json` to schema v2
- taught `repair` and `update --replan` to use self-check and field observations when promoting a stronger spare config
- expanded `migrate-stealth` to upgrade both legacy transports and pre-v7 xhttp installs
- refreshed bilingual docs, release metadata, and lifecycle coverage to the v7.1.0 strongest-direct baseline

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### changed

- made v6 xhttp-only for mutating product paths; `--transport grpc|http2` is now rejected
- added transport-aware post-action self-check using canonical raw xray client json artifacts
- persisted operator verdicts to `/var/lib/xray/self-check.json` and surfaced them in `status --verbose` and `diagnose`
- introduced `export/capabilities.json` and generated compatibility notes from the capability matrix
- added `scripts/measure-stealth.sh` as a local measurement harness for `recommended` and `rescue` variants
- blocked `update`, `repair`, `add-clients`, and `add-keys` on managed legacy transports until `migrate-stealth` is executed
- updated bilingual docs, release metadata, and tests to the xhttp-only v6 baseline

## [5.1.0] - 2026-03-07

### changed

- made `install` a minimal xhttp-first default path with `ru-auto` and auto-selected config count
- moved manual profile/count prompts behind `install --advanced`
- added `migrate-stealth` as the supported managed migration path from legacy `grpc/http2`
- promoted `clients.json` schema v2 with per-config `variants[]`
- generated xhttp client artifacts as `recommended (auto)` and `rescue (packet-up)` variants
- exported raw per-variant xray client json files under `export/raw-xray/`
- expanded lifecycle coverage for minimal install, advanced install, and legacy-to-xhttp migration paths
- refreshed the bilingual docs set to reflect the xhttp-first baseline and legacy-transport compatibility window

## [4.2.3] - 2026-03-06

### changed

- hardened wrapper module loading: runtime now resolves modules only from trusted directories (`SCRIPT_DIR`, `XRAY_DATA_DIR`) instead of honoring external `MODULE_DIR`
- added powershell coverage to `check-security-baseline.sh` and blocked `Invoke-Expression`/`iex`, download-pipe execution patterns, and encoded-command execution
- introduced canonical global profile names `global-50` / `global-50-auto` with backward-compatible legacy aliases `global-ms10` / `global-ms10-auto`
- fixed release quality-gate dependencies so `ripgrep` is installed before `tests/lint.sh`

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-26

### changed

- normalized operations commands to use installed `xray-reality.sh`
- aligned docs wording around ubuntu 24.04 lts support scope
- added explicit compatibility flags: `--allow-no-systemd` and `--require-minisign`
- documented minisign trust-anchor fingerprint policy
- expanded `tier_global_ms10` domain pool from 10 to 50 domains

### fixed

- install now neutralizes conflicting `systemd` drop-ins that override runtime-critical fields
- `install`, `update`, and `repair` now fail fast when `systemd` is unavailable unless compatibility mode is enabled
- strict minisign mode now fails closed when signature verification cannot be completed
- domain planning avoids adjacent duplicate domains when pool size allows
- corrected diagnostics command to use `journalctl --no-pager`
